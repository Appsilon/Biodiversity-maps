# Biodiversity-maps

The project has three phases:

1. Biodiversity maps for the general use of the biodiversity community using data provided by the University of Birmingham. This will show "biodiversity hotspots" â€“ areas of greatest interest to the researchers and conservationists.

2. Similar maps for specific demonstration cases in various regions of Europe.

3. A very exciting project related to anticipating the impact of climate change on various species. This will inform preservation efforts to ensure food security (crops) in a changing world as well as just protecting vulnerable wild species.
