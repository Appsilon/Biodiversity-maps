# Biodiversity-maps

## Project description

The project has three phases:

1. Biodiversity maps for the general use of the biodiversity community using data provided by the University of Birmingham. This will show "biodiversity hotspots" – areas of greatest interest to the researchers and conservationists.

2. Similar maps for specific demonstration cases in various regions of Europe.

3. A very exciting project related to anticipating the impact of climate change on various species. This will inform preservation efforts to ensure food security (crops) in a changing world as well as just protecting vulnerable wild species.

## Data

The data folder linked-up below contains data for plant, animal and forest genetic resources.

The file names and corresponding content are as follows:

* AnGR_FAO_Jan2020.csv – animal genetic resources data

* forestry_jan2020_clean2.csv – forest genetic resources data

* PGR_partial_Jan2020.csv – plant genetic resources data (this is to be combined with the R database, as described below)

The folder also contains an .R database (db3.r) with over 4 million datapoints for crop wild relative distribution in Europe.  This data has come directly from the Farmers Pride project.  The data is in a R database format, so can be used directy in R software.  Jade will eventually be using the data via Python but she hasn't worked out how to get this data working in python yet.  It is important to note that the data folder (specifically the dbr.r file) will need to be combined with the PGR_partial_Jan2020.csv file. That will then give you all the data for the Plat Genetic Resources domain.
